This project is the result of needing
a sample project to use as a starting 
point for new projects. 

It is named: ComposeMVVMSample

The functionality is simple,
but demonstrates basic mvvm,
repository and jetpack compose 
communication and usage.

App consists of a button,
whose color is updated
from a background co-routine
that peridically updates the 
background color of the button,
as stored in the viewmodel class.

These are the steps taken to 
create a new project
based on the ComposeMVVMSample
